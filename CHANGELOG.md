# Changelog

Everything notable about `opencode-plugboard` lands here, newest first. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with one liberty: entries explain why a change was made, not just what changed. If a decision cost something, the cost is written down next to it.

## Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While the major version is 0:

- A minor bump (0.1 to 0.2) may break things: an option renamed, a default changed, an error code moved.
- A patch bump (0.1.0 to 0.1.1) is for fixes only.
- The peer range on OpenCode is part of the contract. Plugboard talks to an unstable host API, so a change to the supported OpenCode range is at least a minor bump.

Work is tracked in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues). The [v0.1 milestone](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/milestone/1) is what had to be true before the first release. The [later milestone](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/milestone/2) holds everything that was deliberately left out.

## [Unreleased]

A second review of 0.1.0, done from scratch by a fresh reviewer at commit `2a70bb6`, found eighteen things worth fixing before the first publish. They are being fixed in parallel right now. This section will be rewritten once they land. For now, by theme:

**Lifecycle safety**
- Plugin setup calls `realpathSync` on every location, so a hung mount could stall the server thread. Ownership has to be worked out later, from request handling ([#31](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/31)).
- The interrupt is keyed on the response ending, not the host execution ending, so a failed step can leave the provider being called for up to 30 seconds ([#33](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/33)).
- Requests should fail closed when an app directory has no context hook, instead of sending the raw transcript as an ordinary prompt ([#35](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/35)).
- Host calls cannot be cancelled, so a deadline during preparation can still create a session ([#40](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/40)).
- Host inputs should be checked with `satisfies`, not cast, so an OpenCode upgrade breaks the type check instead of the runtime ([#41](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/41)).

**HTTP and streaming**
- The SSE backpressure wait ignores the request deadline, so a client that stops reading keeps a handler alive forever ([#32](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/32)).
- Stream failures before any visible content return 200 and log `ok` ([#38](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/38)).
- The event queue and the total image bytes per request need a bound ([#39](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/39)).

**Protocol validation**
- `tools` together with `json_schema` silently drops the caller's tools ([#34](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/34)).
- A tool call overwrites `length` and `content_filter` finish reasons ([#36](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/36)).
- A tool or alias named `__proto__` disappears ([#37](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/37)).
- Malformed request fields are repaired instead of rejected; `127.0.0.2` counts as loopback but fails the Host check; duplicate key values are accepted ([#42](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/42)).

**Docs and compatibility checks**
- Say where history is really stored ([#43](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/43)).
- Remove claims the code no longer matches ([#44](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/44)).
- A working recipe for reaching plugboard from another host or container ([#45](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/45)).
- Compat runners that print PASS after failures ([#46](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/46)).
- The Open WebUI script leaves a token in a world-readable temp file ([#47](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/47)).
- Clean up compat results and add a release-candidate acceptance record ([#48](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/48)).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

Not yet published to npm. Install from a checkout until [#29](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/29) is done.

### Why this exists

You log in to ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot or OpenCode Go once, in OpenCode. Then every other tool you run (a fitness app, a Discord bot, n8n, Open WebUI, a script) wants its own key or its own gateway with its own logins. Those tools all speak the OpenAI API. OpenCode V2 does not.

V2's server API is built for agents: sessions run tools on the server, and the one-shot generate call takes a prompt and returns text. An app that sends a chat plus a tool list and expects tool calls back has nowhere to go. The V1 plugins that filled the gap, `opencode-llm-proxy` most notably, stopped working when V2 changed the plugin and server APIs. Before writing any code I checked whether anything V2-native existed. Nothing did, and the upstream feature request for it was closed by a bot without a maintainer reply.

So plugboard is a V2 plugin that serves an OpenAI-compatible endpoint from inside your OpenCode server, using the providers and logins you already have. Tool calls go back to the caller. OpenCode never runs your tools.

SparkyFitness was the first real app verified against it. The first spike proved the idea worked. The rest of 0.1.0 is what it took to make that spike safe to leave running.

### Highlights

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` with streaming, tools, images and structured output.
- Works with whatever works in an OpenCode session on your server: ChatGPT, Claude (including through an auth plugin), Copilot, OpenCode Go and API-key providers. Checked on ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot and OpenCode Go.
- Tool calls come back un-executed, in the shape OpenAI clients expect.
- An explicit model allowlist, so nothing is exposed by accident.
- One key per app, with each app's history kept apart from your real projects.
- Eight real clients checked: both OpenAI SDKs, the Vercel AI SDK, LangChain in Python and JS, pydantic-ai, Open WebUI and n8n.

### Added

**Endpoints**
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Messages with system, developer, user text and images, assistant `tool_calls` and tool results. Parameters: `tools`, `tool_choice`, `response_format`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `stop`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `reasoning_effort`.
- `GET /v1/models`, listing the allowlist intersected with the models enabled on your server, plus your aliases. Ids are de-duplicated. Each entry carries `owned_by` set to the provider and a small `plugboard` object with capabilities and context limit.
- `GET /v1/models/{id}` ([#9](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/9)). `client.models.retrieve("fast")` used to fail with a 404, and some UIs call it to validate a configured model. Ids like `openai/gpt-6-luna#low` contain `/` and `#`, and the SDKs percent-encode them, so the router decodes before lookup. Aliases resolve, and a model outside the allowlist gets the same 404 `model_not_found` as the chat route.
- `GET /healthz`.

**Streaming**
- SSE with text deltas, tool calls, finish reason, a final usage chunk when `stream_options.include_usage` is set, and `[DONE]`. Text arrives as the model produces it. A streamed tool call arrives as one delta carrying the whole arguments string.
- A failure after the stream has started arrives as an `error` event followed by `[DONE]`. A failure before it starts is a normal HTTP error.

**Tools go back to the caller**
- Caller tools are offered to the model and returned as `tool_calls`. Tool-result turns work. Nothing of yours is executed by OpenCode.
- Up to `maxTools` tools per request (default 32). A request over the limit gets a 400 `too_many_tools` that names the option.

**Images**
- Image inputs as `data:` URLs.
- Remote image URLs are off by default (`remoteImages`). Turned on, the server fetches them with a 20 MB cap, no redirects and `image/*` only.

**Structured output**
- `response_format` with `json_schema` works through a forced `respond` tool, and its arguments come back as the message content.
- `json_object` uses a short system instruction instead ([#11](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/11)). The first version used the same forced tool with an open object schema. On a small model that gave `{}` four times out of four, because the model had nothing to aim at.

**Models**
- An allowlist in the `models` option: `provider/model`, `provider/model#variant`, or `provider/*`. With none configured, `/v1/models` is empty and chat calls get a 403 that names the option.
- Aliases, so a client that mishandles `/` and `#` in ids can use `fast` instead. Every alias target must pass the allowlist.
- Variants. `reasoning_effort` picks a variant when the model name has none and the model has one by that name. An alias can fix an effort level for a client that cannot send one.

**Apps and history**
- One API key per app. The key name is the app name and also its history directory. Names match `[a-z0-9-]+`, and `default` is reserved for keyless loopback use.
- Every request is kept as an OpenCode session holding the full caller transcript (system prompt, messages, images as attachments, tool calls and results) plus the reply. The title is the first user message. Each app has its own directory under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode-plugboard/`, so plugboard's sessions stay out of your real projects' lists.
- An `x-plugboard-session` response header with the OpenCode session id ([#12](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/12)). After several clients shared one app with identical prompts in the same seconds, nobody could tell whose sessions were whose, and cleanup had to guess.
- Usage numbers that agree with each other ([#10](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/10)). The same prompt had returned `completion_tokens: 3` with `reasoning_tokens: 64` in one run and `completion_tokens: 83` with `reasoning_tokens: 0` in another. Usage is now inclusive: reasoning tokens count inside `completion_tokens` and `total_tokens`, for stream and non-stream alike, as OpenAI reports them.

**Operations**
- A warm-up recipe for always-on servers, as a systemd `ExecStartPost` and a launchd job. See Known limitations for why it is needed.
- A `listen` option (default `127.0.0.1:4010`), `requestTimeoutMs` (default 10 minutes), and `{env:VAR}` expansion for keys.

### How it works

Each request becomes a session in the calling app's directory, run through OpenCode's own request path. That detail is the whole reason for the design. Provider fixes and auth plugins, such as the one that lets Claude Max work, only run inside a session's request pipeline. A plugin that calls a provider directly skips them, and ChatGPT, Copilot and Claude logins break.

So plugboard steers a session instead:

1. A front-end turns the OpenAI request into a format-neutral request. The core checks the key and resolves the model.
2. The session backend creates a session and uses a `context` hook to swap the caller's system prompt, messages and tools in for OpenCode's own. In the spike, a "reply with pong" prompt cost 13 tokens instead of the roughly 10,400 that OpenCode's own prompt and tools add.
3. Caller tools map onto a pool of placeholder tools. A placeholder settles at once with a fixed result, so history shows a completed call.
4. When the model has emitted its tool calls, plugboard interrupts the turn and returns the calls. Without the interrupt, OpenCode's runner would start a second model step after any tool result.
5. The front-end encodes the events as JSON or SSE. The session stays as history.

The model call sits behind one interface, `ModelCaller`, with names that mirror OpenCode's own `@opencode/ai` types. A native backend can replace the session backend later without touching the front-ends. [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) has the lifetimes, the process-wide state and the rules in detail.

### Design decisions

The ones that shaped the code, with the reasons.

**V2 only.** V1 and V2 differ in plugin API, server API and session model. Supporting both would mean two plugins sharing a README. The V1 ecosystem already has `opencode-llm-proxy`. V2 had nothing.

**A session backend now, a native one later.** The cleaner design is an upstream `ctx.llm.stream` that runs one provider turn through the session hook pipeline with no persistence. I think that is where this should end up, and the seam for it exists ([#3](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/3)). But shipping would then wait on maintainers who did not answer the original request, and a plugin that calls the AI layer directly skips the hooks that make ChatGPT, Copilot and Claude work. The session path works on four providers today. It costs session setup per call, writes history that has to be managed, needs the plugin loaded in every directory, and its interrupt can race the runner ([#14](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/14)). I took that bill to ship now.

**Its own port, not an OpenCode route.** Plugins cannot register routes on OpenCode's server. The only door is the RPC endpoint, which OpenAI clients cannot call with OpenCode's password and shape. Plugboard opens its own listener (default `127.0.0.1:4010`), once per process, because OpenCode loads a plugin once per project directory.

**Callers never get OpenCode's password.** Reusing it would hand every app full control of the server. Callers use plugboard keys. With no keys configured, only a loopback bind is accepted. Binding elsewhere without keys refuses to start. Once any key exists, every request needs one, loopback included.

**An explicit model allowlist.** The first idea was to list every model with an active credential. Then every model on your account becomes reachable by anything that can reach the port, including expensive ones. You now name what callers may use, or nothing is exposed.

**History is kept, per app.** I wanted to be able to see what each app asked and what the model answered, and deleting sessions after each reply would have thrown that away. The price is that OpenCode loads hooks per directory, so plugboard has to be loaded in the app directories, which means a global install. Everywhere else it is inert: it joins the shared listener and registers no hooks, tools or agent rules, so your real projects behave as before. Pruning is deferred ([#8](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/8)), because the plugin session API has no `list` and pruning needs its own index.

**`json_schema` through a forced tool.** It behaves the same on every provider, and it is how OpenCode does structured output itself. The cost is that no provider enforces the schema.

**No OpenCode prompt or tools reach the model.** An endpoint called by a food-logging app should not tell the model it is a coding agent with shell access. The caller's system prompt and tools replace OpenCode's. Permissions on request sessions deny everything except the placeholders, so a step that slips past the interrupt still cannot run a real tool.

**Plain naming.** Early candidates were poetic. They were rejected because new users could not say them or guess what they do. `opencode-plugboard` is plain, readable, and not tied to one API format.

**Other defaults chosen on purpose.** A request gets a 404 `model_not_found` for an unknown or disallowed model. `n` above 1, `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` return 400. `parallel_tool_calls` and `seed` are accepted and ignored. There is no per-app concurrency limit.

### Safety and hardening

**The freeze.** The first spike was registered in a real project on a live OpenCode server and froze every prompt in that project. The plugin's setup effect ended with an inline `Effect.never`. OpenCode runs plugin effects inside activation, and sessions wait for activation to finish, so the location waited forever. I reproduced it later in isolation. That one mistake produced the rules everything else follows:

- Plugboard is developed only against an isolated OpenCode server with its own home directory, never the live one.
- Every change must pass the pong gate first: after the plugin loads, a plain prompt in a throwaway project and in an app directory must still come back with `pong`.
- Setup only registers and returns. It awaits nothing from the session or model APIs.
- Finalizers are synchronous and call nothing on the host.
- Nothing is registered outside plugboard's data root, so in a real project the plugin does nothing but join the listener. The check compares real paths.
- Request work runs on a process-wide runtime owned by the listener, so an unrelated project reloading does not kill a request in flight.

**Web attacks.** An endpoint on localhost is reachable from any web page in your browser. On a loopback bind, requests with a `Host` header that is not `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `[::1]` get 403 `invalid_host`, which stops DNS rebinding. Without keys, a request carrying an `Origin` header gets 403 `cross_origin_forbidden`. `POST` bodies must be `application/json`, or the answer is 415.

**Remote images are off by default.** Fetching a URL a caller supplies lets that caller make your server request internal addresses. Callers can always send `data:` URLs. The option exists for people who accept that risk.

**Options are authoritative.** OpenCode loads the plugin once per directory, and each load could carry different options. The first accepted load decides. A load with different options logs once and stays inert, so a project entry cannot serve with weaker auth than the live one. When no generation is live, such as mid-reload, the next one's options are adopted.

**The request guard outlives the response.** The state that makes the context hook rewrite a session is released only when OpenCode reports the execution ended, not when the HTTP response ends. If the host never confirms, a 30 second bound logs `session.cleanup_timeout`, retries the interrupt and releases. Nothing in teardown waits on this.

**Deny-all permissions.** Request sessions are created with `deny *`, then `allow` for the placeholders. A person prompting inside an app directory never sees the placeholders, and a request session never sees a real tool.

**Symlink containment.** Plugboard compares real paths when it decides whether a directory is inside its data root, so a symlink does not make a real project look like an app directory or the reverse.

**Cancellation, deadlines and backpressure.** Each request has one scope that holds both the client disconnect and a single deadline (`requestTimeoutMs`). A disconnect, SSE included, interrupts the request. A slow SSE reader is paced by backpressure instead of growing a buffer. The second review found gaps here, listed under Unreleased.

**Validation.** A malformed request URL returns 400 instead of an unhandled rejection. Bad bodies get 400 or 413. Aliases and timeouts are validated on load. Missing placeholders or attachments fail the request with `backend_preparation_failed` instead of silently dropping a tool. Event subscriptions are filtered by session id before anything is buffered, so other projects' sessions are never held.

**What the logs hold.** One line per request: ids and outcomes only, never keys, bodies or URLs.

### Compatibility

Checked on 2026-10-11 by driving each client's own SDK or API against a dev server: one plain chat, a tool round trip, streaming, an image and structured output, on a small fast model, a Claude model and a ChatGPT model. The raw evidence is in `compat/results`. I did not use a browser for Open WebUI, so the results there come from its API.

| Client | Version | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Python SDK | `openai` 3.29.0 | pass |
| OpenAI JS SDK | `openai` 7.32.0 | pass |
| Vercel AI SDK | `ai` 7.0.137, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 3.0.67, `@ai-sdk/openai` 4.0.91 | pass with `createOpenAICompatible` or `.chat(id)`. `openai(id)` calls `/v1/responses` |
| LangChain Python | `langchain-openai` 1.7.0 | pass |
| LangChain JS | `@langchain/openai` 1.6.2 | pass except `gpt-5.6*` ids, which force the Responses API |
| pydantic-ai | `pydantic-ai-slim` 2.55.0 | pass with `OpenAIChatModel` |
| Open WebUI | 0.12.0 | pass |
| n8n | 2.42.6 | pass with "Use Responses API" off. Sampling options hit [#30](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/30) |

Providers, through the session path: GitHub Copilot, Anthropic (Claude Max through an auth plugin), OpenAI (ChatGPT, with a `#variant`) and OpenCode Go. Each passed plain text, a tool call returned un-executed, a tool-result turn and an image, sixteen checks out of sixteen, at 0.6 to 5.7 seconds each. That run came before the final cross-directory design, so the second review's acceptance record ([#48](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/48)) is meant to repeat it on the release commit.

### Known limitations

- **No `/v1/responses`** ([#1](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/1)). Clients that default to the Responses API get `404 No route for POST /v1/responses`. The workarounds are in the table above. This is the first thing planned after 0.1. It stayed out only because the release gate was written for Chat Completions.
- **`tool_choice` is best effort** ([#13](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/13)). `auto` and `none` work. `required` and a named function are sent to the model as an instruction, because the session API cannot set a tool choice, and a model can still answer in text. The forced `respond` tool for structured output has the same limit. The native backend closes it.
- **The interrupt can race the runner's next step** ([#14](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/14)). In practice the interrupt wins. If it loses, a second model step is wasted: tokens, and a stray message in history, but no wrong output for the caller.
- **The listener needs a warm-up** ([#15](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/15)). OpenCode loads no plugin until a client touches the server, so after a restart the port stays closed until something connects. The README has the warm-up recipes. The real fix is upstream, and I plan to file that request once 0.1.0 is out ([#2](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/2)).
- **Sampling parameters some providers reject come back as 400** ([#30](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/30)). Plugboard forwards them faithfully. Real OpenAI behaves the same on its reasoning models, but clients rarely expect a 400 for a temperature knob.
- **No pruning of history** ([#8](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/8)).
- **No other front-ends yet.** Anthropic Messages ([#4](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/4)), Gemini ([#5](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/5)) and OpenCode agents as models ([#6](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/6)) are planned. Embeddings, audio and image generation are not.
- **Pinned to OpenCode 2.0.26** (peer range `>=2.0.26 <2.1`). The host's session API is not stable across versions. Type-level checks make the build fail when the pinned host changes shape.
- **No automated test suite.** The checks are the type checker and live runs against an isolated server, including the client matrix above. The second review's items [#46](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/46) and [#48](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/48) are about making those runs more trustworthy.
- **Unpublished.** Not on npm yet ([#29](https://github.com/jjjermiah/opencode-plugboard/issues/29)).

### Acknowledgements

`opencode-llm-proxy` by KochC got the shape right first: a plugin that starts a local server and reuses OpenCode's providers. It is V1 only, which is why this project exists. `copilot-api` and LiteLLM showed what an OpenAI-compatible front door should feel like to the people calling it. No code was taken from any of them. They were reading material.
